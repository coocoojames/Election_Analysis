# Election Analysis
## Project Purpose
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. The puspose of the project is to:
    1. Analyze the results of each candidate in each county.
    2. To determine possible advantage or disadvantage each candidate might have in each county.
    3. Find possible correlation between counties and candidate success

## Other Possible Uses for This Script
This script is designed to see how much a county participates in a local congressinal election and how well a candidate has to do in a particular county to win the election. That being said, with a few modifications it can be used to any election one wants to analyze.<br />
First, we can change county into any region. If you want to see the participation rate and/or turnout of each state, simply import data from said states and change "counties" to "states." The same goes to the scope of the eleciton! It doesn't have to be a local election.<br />
Second, if you modify counties and candidates so that you get a count of each candidate's votes in each county, you can also get how many votes are won in each county for each candidate. That could also be applied to a presidential candidate in each state!
